# Basketball-Playoff-Prediction-Flask-app  
This is a Flask application deployed on Heroku online platform.  The aim of this program is to give you a prediction on playoff participation based on the regular season's first 10 matches. 
Input data: number of wins, losses and sum of scored points by the team and by the opposites from the first 10 matches.
The prediction uses an open-source dataset from Kaggle including all the results of the NBA seasons from 1947 to 2015.  
For training, testing and prediction I used a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest Classifier.  
If the predicted value is 1, the team would participate in Playoffs, if the result is 0, the team is not likely to get in the Playoffs.

  There is a lot more to come regarding this app, I just wanted to create the structure and the deployment to have a skeleton which I can build on in the coming weeks.
